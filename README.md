# genius-lyrics-now-playing

Requires Windows PowerShell 5.1 (doesnt work with PowerShell 7)

A small PowerShell script that reads what you are playing from Windows Media Transport Controls API and opens the Genius page for its lyrics.

I recommend creating a shortcut file and setting a specific key shortcuts to open it directly. 

Target: C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\path\to\genius-lyrics.ps1"  (-ExecutionPolicy Bypass needed because Windows defaults to blocking unsigned scripts)

Start in: %windir%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0




Select a combination of keys you like and you are ready to go!
